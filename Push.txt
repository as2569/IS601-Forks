Push: The git push command is used to upload to local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing.

Example: git push <remote> <branch> : This command pushes the specified branch to <remote>, along with all of the necessary commits and internal objects. This creates a local branch in the destination repository. To prevent you from overwriting commits, Git won't let you push when it results in a non-fast-forward merge in the destination repository.
Example: git push <remote> --force : This command is the same as the above command, but forces the push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use the --force flag unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.
Example: git push <remote> --all : This command pushes all of your local brances to the specified remote.
Example: git push <remote> --tags : Tags are not automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the --all option. The --tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repository.
