Remote Add / Remove / Show
Remote Add: The “remote add” command allows you to  add a new remote. In order to do this, you must use the git remote add command on the terminal in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:
A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
Example:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
Remove: The command “git-rm” removes files from the working tree, the index, and the repository.
        
Example: In order to remove a file added in the most recent unpushed commit
(If the file was added with your most recent commit, and you have not pushed to GitHub, you can delete the file and amend the commit):
Open Terminal.
Change the current working directory to your local repository.
To remove the file, enter git rm --cached:
$ git rm --cached giant_file 
Stage our giant file for removal, but leave it on disk

Commit this change using --amend -CHEAD:
$ git commit --amend -CHEAD
Amend the previous commit with your change
Simply making a new commit won't work, as you need
to remove the file from the unpushed history as well

Push your commits to GitHub:
$ git push
Push our rewritten, smaller commit

Show: The command “git-show” shows various types of objects. Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).
Synopsis: git show [<options>] [<object>…​]
For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by git diff-tree --cc.
For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.
For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to git ls-tree with --name-only).
For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.
The command takes options applicable to the git diff-tree command to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.
Example: <object>... – This command will show the names of the objects.
