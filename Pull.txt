Pull: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that context. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge. In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.

Example: git pull <remote> : This command fetches the specified remote's copy of the current branch and immediately merges it into the local copy. This is the same as git fetch <remote> followed by git merge origin/<current-branch>.
Example: git pull --no-commit <remote> : This command is similar to the default invocation and fetches the remote content but does not create a new merge commit.
Example: git pull --rebase <remote> : This command is the same as the previous pull but instead of using git merge to integrate the remote branch with the local one, it uses git rebase.
Example: git pull --verbose : This command gives verbose output during a pull which displays the content being downloaded and the merge details.
