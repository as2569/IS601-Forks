Merge: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Example: The code below creates a new branch, adds two commits to it, then integrates it into the main line with a fast-forward merge. This is a common workflow for short-lived topic branches that are used more as an isolated development than an organizational tool for longer-running features.

#Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature master
#Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"
#Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"
#Merge in the new-feature branch
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
