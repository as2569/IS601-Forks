home directory and ~

A home directory is a directory which contains the personal files of a particular user of the system. The tilde (~) symbol stands for your home directory and it is used as a shortcut to get to your home directory. If you are user, then the tilde (~) stands for /home/user. 

Whenever you add a user to Ubuntu, either by installing Ubuntu or manually adding a new user, Ubuntu creates a /home/username directory for that user with their username. The /home/username directory is often referred to as just "the home directory". 
About the home directory
You can have as many /home/username directories as you have users. 
Each user has full read/write/execute access to his or her /home/username directory. 
Each user can make their /home/username directory unreadable by other users. 
Each user can fully customize their Desktop layout/background, sounds, window manager, applications, etc. 

The home directory is: 
Where your Desktop resides. 
Where your documents, pictures, music, videos, audio, and pretty much everything else can be stored. 
Where your application settings are stored, in hidden files and directories (their names start with a . ) that you should not touch unless you know what you are doing.
Eg, /home/username/.thunderbird contains your Thunderbird emails and contacts, /home/username/.mozilla contains Firefox bookmarks, passwords, history, plugins… 
The only place (with the exclusion of removable drives and the /tmp directory) within the Ubuntu file system where a user can freely create/modify/remove files and directories without needing root permissions or the sudo command.
Example: /home/Ar/Pictures/waterfall.jpg OR ~/Pictures/waterfall.jpg – Most users interact primarily with their home directory, so the tilde (~) character is used as a shorthand.
This means that I can express an example waterfall picture as either /home/Ar/Pictures/waterfall.jpg or as ~/Pictures/waterfall.jpg.
