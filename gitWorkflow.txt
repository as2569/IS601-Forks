The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This means it dictates what kind of branches to set up and how to merge them together. 
Gitflow offers a dedicated channel for hotfixes to production and workflow is great for a release-based software workflow. 

The overall flow of Gitflow is:
A develop branch is created from master
A release branch is created from develop
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master
